The global agriculture industry contributes USD 2.4 trillion, making the agriculture field as important as any other industry in the world. All around the world, 45 percentage of people are reliant on agriculture for their livelihood an in India almost 60 percentage of the population are involved in agriculture and related activities. The agriculture sector, currently valued at US$ 370 billion, is one of the major sectors in the Indian economy. According to the Economic Survey 2020-21, GDP contribution by the agriculture sector is likely to be 19.9% in 2020-21, increasing from 17.8% recorded in 2019-20. So these facts prove that agriculture is inevitable process as everyone still eats food. <br />

But nowadays agriculture itself has become a tedious task due to climate change , natural calamities, water scarcity etc… These things make agriculture a big challenge and force the farmers to quit. Using technologies would be an solution for making agriculture easier and help the farmers increase their productivity. There are many existing technologies and methods to enhance farming but these are not feasible. But this scenario should change and farmer should become smart and take the help of technology to overcome these challenges. Hence we have come with a solution SmartFarmer an Iot enabled smart farming application which helps the farmer to   monitor the soil and weather conditions and can water the crops remotely.<br />

With rising population, there is a need for increased agricultural production. In order to support greater production in farms, the requirement of the amount of fresh  water used in irrigation also rises. Currently, agriculture  accounts 83% of the total water consumption in India . Unplanned use of water inadvertently results in wastage of water. Watering of a crops is also decided by the soil moisture level, weather conditions and amount of water content in air.

So to efficiently water crops we need to monitor the soil moisture, temperature and humidity. In our project we accomplish the task of monitoring these parameter by deploying various sensors and farmers can monitor all the sensor parameters by using a web or mobile application even if the farmer is not near his field. They can make the decision whether to water the crop or postpone it by monitoring the sensor parameters and controlling the motor pumps from the mobile application itself.
Implementing these technological solutions enable reliable management and monitoring of farms. As farmers get a complete digital analysis of farms in real-time, they can act accordingly. The advantages of the system are <br />
•	Increases agriculture productivity and lowers production cost <br />
•	Inhibits soil degradation <br />
•	Promotes effective and efficient use of water resources <br />
•	Uplifts socio-economic statuses of farmers <br />
•	Reduces environmental and ecological impacts <br />
•	Augments worker safety <br />
